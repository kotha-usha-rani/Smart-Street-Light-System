# Smart-Street-Light-System
Arduino Project  

INTRODUCTION  
Automation plays an important role in the world economy and in daily life .Automatic systems are being preferred over manual system. The research work shows automatic control of street light as a result of which power is saved to some extent.Basically, street lighting is one of the important part. Street lights were controlled manually where a control switch is set in each of the street lamps. Due to technological developments, the street lighting system is advanced to automatic street light system where the street lights are switched ON and OFF automatically by sensing an obstacle. Our project aims at developing a smart street light system in which lights are switched on when needed and switched off when not needed.

AIM  
The aim of this project is to develop a smart street light system using automation technology. In this project, the street lights are switched on and switched off automatically when there is an obstacle.

CONCLUSION  
By using smart street lights, one can save a surplus amount of energy. It prevents unnecessary wastage of electricity, caused due to manual switching of street lights when itâ€™s not required. It provides an efficient and smart automatic street light control system with the help of IR sensors. It can reduce the energy consumption and maintain the cost. It clearly tackles two problems the world is facing today: saving of energy and also disposal of incandescent lamps, very efficiently. According to statistical data we can save more than 40% of electrical energy that is now consumed by highways. Initial cost and maintenance of the project can be main drawbacks. With the advances in technology and good resource planning the cost of the project can be cut down and also with the use of good equipment the maintenance can also be reduced in terms of periodic checks.
